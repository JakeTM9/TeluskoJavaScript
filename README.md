I follow along an extensive Youtube javascript course

Navigate the branches for content.

Big fan of Telusko's stuff. I will probably keep taking his courses- probably git next

EDIT 3/20/2019: halfway done- just got back from spring break, will resume tomorrow :)

EDIT 3/28/209: getting busier at work - slowing down
